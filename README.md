# Wiki

This represent a wiki of my learning in computer science and programming.

## Idea

The idea is that this will become my knowledge base. Similar to a codebase, it will grow, get refactored and adapt with time.

My goal is to learn the topics listed bellow (not exclusively) and add what I learn to this repository.

This will also serve as reinforcement for the learning, as I will have to add the gained information to this repository while keeping it organized.

## Motivation

This video from Johnathan Blow.

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I0s1MXRxPLw

In the video he mentions these topics:

**I have loosely ordered these in the order I would like to go through them.**

- [Linear Algebra](/linear_algebra)
- [Time complexity of algorithms](/algorithms)
  - Sorting algorithms
- [Data structures](/data_structures)
  - How they live in memory
  - Binary tree
- [Boolean logic](/booleans) -> find resources
- [Floating point numbers](/floats) -> find resources
- [Programming paradigms](/paradigms) -> find resources
  - Functional
  - Imperative
  - Declarative
- [Recursion](/recursion) -> find resources
- [Concurrency](/concurrency) -> find resources
  - Data races
  - Databases
    - Data normalization
- [Implement malloc](/malloc) -> find resources
- [Operating systems](/operating_systems) -> find resources

## Other Learning

These are other things I am interested in learning from:

**I have loosely ordered these in the order I would like to go through them.**

- [But How Do It Know?](/how_know) -> completed
- [RISC-V Assembly Programming](/risc_v) -> on hold
- [Writing An Interpreter In Go](/interpreter_go) -> in progress
- [Writing A Compiler In Go](/compiler_go)
- [C Fundamentals](/c_lang)
- [Handmade Hero](/handmade_hero) -> in progress
- [C Programming and Memory Management](/memory_management)
